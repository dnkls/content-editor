1 - Content Editor
==============

Content Editor is a web interface for editing documents on GitHub. It allows content writers to create, edit, upload, move and delete files from a web browser, lowering the amount of technical knowledge required to manage files on GitHub.

With the growth in popularity of static-site generators, it is often desirable to store content as simple text files alongside the code files that make up a website. This can present a problem for content writers, as code repositories typically use version control software to keep track of file changes which can be difficult to use and require a degree of technical know-how. By comparison, sites that use content management systems, i.e. that store content as data in a database, typically provide a web-based administration panel with a rich-text editor that is more accessible for most content authors.

Content Editor tries to plug this gap by providing a user experience that is simple and responsive, whilst at the same time respecting the difference between these architectures. There are a plethora of static-site generators: Jekyll, Hexo, Hugo, Pelican, Middleman, Metalsmith, Harp, Docpad...etc each with their own ideas about the best ways to store content. By default, Content Editor simply provides a direct text editor for content without trying to be too clever with assumptions  on how the files are formatted.
