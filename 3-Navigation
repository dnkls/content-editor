Content Editor uses the following format for URLs, that reflects GitHub's own organisation of repositories:

    https://content-editor.surge.sh/:owner:/:repo:/:branch:/:path

Each repository has an owner and a name. The owner is the user or organisation who's responsible for the repository. Whilst there may be many collaborators who have been granted permission to edit a repository, the project is still attributable to a single owner.

For each repository, there can be multiple branches. These can be different versions of the same project but with minor changes, like a new feature that someone's working on, or they can contain a completely different set of files for a purpose that run's complementary to the other branches, such as a place to keep documentation files. Most repositories tend to use the `master` branch most of the time as it's the default when creating a new repository, but it's also quite common for sites that are hosted on GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch to.

After that, the path is just made up of files and folders, just like a typical file-system.

Take this URL for an example:

    https://content-editor.surge.sh/facebook/react/master/docs/_posts/2013-06-05-why-react.md

From the URL, you can see that it is a file on the master branch of the React repository that's owned by Facebook.
