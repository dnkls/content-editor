3 - Front Matter
=============

It is common for content files to place metadata at the top of a file. This is referred to as the files Front Matter. For example, a file may start like this:

    ---
    title: Blogging is 4 Life
    date: 2015-09-01
    author: Christopher
    tags: [Lifestyle, Thoughts]
    ---

This would inform any program that uses this content file, like a static-site generator, that this post is entitled "Blogging is 4 Life", was written by Christopher on 1st September 2015 and could be related to other posts that are also tagged "Lifestyle" or "Thoughts".

This example uses the YAML format with 3 dashes to delineate the start and end of the Front Matter. This is a popular format but there are many others that may be prefered by different generators.

For instance, the same metadata with JSON formatting could be written as:

    ;;;
    "title": "Blogging is 4 Life",
    "date": "2015-09-01",
    "author": "Christopher"
    "tags": ["Lifestyle", "Thoughts"]
    ;;;

Or with TOML:

    +++
    title="Blogging is 4 Life"
    date="2015-09-01"
    author="Christopher"
    tags=["Lifestyle", "Thoughts"]
    +++

Or in reStructuredText:

    Blogging is 4 Life
    ##############

    :date: 2015-09-01
    :author: Christopher
    :tags: Lifestyle, Thoughts
