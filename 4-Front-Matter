4 - Front Matter
=============

It is common for content files to place metadata at the top of a file. This is referred to as the files Front Matter. For example, a file may start like this:

    ---
      title: Blogging is 4 Life
      date: 2015-09-01 00:00:00
      author: PJay
      tags: [Lifestyle, Thoughts]
    ---

    The content of the file would follow here......

This would inform any program that uses this content file, like a static-site generator, that this post is entitled "Blogging is 4 Life", was written by PJay on 1st September 2015 and could be related to other posts that are also tagged "Lifestyle" or "Thoughts".

This example uses the YAML format with 3 dashes to delineate the start and end of the Front Matter.
